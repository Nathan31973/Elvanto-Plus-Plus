This is where you can create a permission file to restrict or grant access to specific features in Elvanto Plus Plus. If your church does not have a permission file in the repository, Elvanto Plus Plus will use the default permissions provided in the asset repository.

## Note
- Kill Switch: Elvanto Plus Plus uses a global kill switch to disable plugin features if a bug disrupts Elvanto Live chat. These kill switches are located in the [asset repository](https://github.com/Nathan31973/Elvanto-Plus-Plus-Assets/tree/main) and only affect plugin features, not Elvanto Liveâ€™s default functionality.

- Bug Reporting: If you encounter a bug, please submit an issue on the issue page.
